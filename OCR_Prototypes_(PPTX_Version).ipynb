For our tests, we created a vacuum using a syringe to make the leaf disks sink before putting them into a glass of a bicarbonate solution exposed to sunlight to see how long it would take the leaves to photosynthesize, creating oxygen and causing them to float.  To test our hypothesis that an increased substrate concentration would also increase the rate of photosynthesis, we ran this experiment with multiple trials of different bicarbonate concentrations, ranging from zero to four grams.  Our results supported our hypothesis, suggesting that a photosynthesizing plant in an environment with higher carbon dioxide levels would photosynthesize quicker.\n",
